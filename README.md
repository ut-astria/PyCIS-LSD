## OVERVIEW:

This algorithm takes in a dense data cube of optical time-series data and looks for narrow lines corresponding to streaks or actively tracked trajectories.  
For a more detailed discussion of *a-contrario* analysis see the main PyCIS pipeline which calls this algorithm.


------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPERATION:

This software is designed to be used as a subsegment of the main PyCIS processing pipeline. 
The PyCIS main pipeline will control setup, if used.  Otherwise, see the main pipleine for instruction on operating PyCIS-LSD

**Setup**
   If scripts cannot be read, run:
   `<dos2unix *.sh>`
   Finally, install prerequisites and build the software by running:
   `<. setup.sh>`.



**Demo**:
  See the main PyCIS pipeline for demo scripts and data download instructions.  


**Output Files**:
Input and output locations and names are specified within the main file, see `<demo.py>` for example.

* Input: data/...
    * yyymmdd_norad_satname/*.fit - a folder with raw fits frames [see citations in DATASET section below] 
* Output: 
    * results_work/... 
        * data1_x_y_name.npy - edge line detections, x and y labels for parallelization are absent when merged.
        * data2_x_y_name.npy - center line detections, x and y labels for parallelization are absent when merged.

Runtime estimates for the two-dataset demo are around 30 minutes on one TACC none with full memory, 48-thread opm capability.
